# AI Model Interface Creator

Created by: [**RÃ©my Charles**](https://github.com/RemyCHARLES)

## **Description**

This idea is about creating a tool that will allow to create an AI model for each user who wants an Artificial Intelligence model for his project. This tool will be a web application that will allow the user to create his own AI model. The user will be able to choose the type of model he wants to create, the type of data he wants to use and the type of data they want to predic.

## **Phase 1: Research**

### **1.1. Problem**

The problem is that it is very difficult for a person who does not have a background in Artificial Intelligence to create an AI model. The person will have to learn a lot of things before being able to create an AI model. The person will have to learn about the different types of models, the different types of data, the different types of data to predict, the different types of algorithms, the different types of libraries, etc. This is a very long process that will take a lot of time and effort.

### **1.2. Solution**

The solution is to create a tool that will allow the user to create an AI model without having to learn a lot of things. The user will be able to choose the type of model he wants to create, the type of data he wants to use and the type of data they want to predic. The tool will create the AI model for the user.

### **1.3. Research**

* #### **1.3.1. Existing solutions**

   There are already some tools that allow to create an AI model. For example, [**Google AutoML**](https://cloud.google.com/automl) allows to create an AI model without having to learn a lot of things. The user will be able to choose the type of model he wants to create, the type of data he wants to use and the type of data they want to predic. The tool will create the AI model for the user. The problem with this tool is that it is not free and it is not open source.

* #### **1.3.2. Similar projects**

   There are no similar projects.

* #### **1.3.3. Competitors**

    There are no competitors.

* #### **1.3.4. Market**

    The market is very large because there are a lot of people who want to create an AI model but who do not have the knowledge to do so. This tool will allow them to create an AI model without having to learn a lot of things. 

### **1.4. Conclusion**

The conclusion is that there is a need for this tool because there are a lot of people who want to create an AI model but who do not have the knowledge to do so. This tool will allow them to create an AI model without having to learn a lot of things. 

## **Phase 2: Design**

### **2.1. Architecture**

The architecture of the tool will be a web application. The user will be able to create an AI model by choosing the type of model he wants to create, the type of data he wants to use and the type of data they want to predic. The tool will allow the user to create the architecture of the model. The user will be able to choose the type of layers he wants to use and the number of neurons for each layer. 

### **2.2. User Interface**

The user interface of the tool will be very clean and simple. 
With an UX/UI design that will be very intuitive and easy to use. 

### **2.3. Database**

The database of the tool will be a NoSQL database. The database will store the data of the user and the data of the AI model. 

### **2.4. Security**

The security of the tool will be very important. The user will be able to create an account and to log in. The user will be able to create an AI model and to save it. The user will be able to share the AI model with other users. The user will be able to delete the AI model.

### **2.5. Performance**

The performance of the tool will be very important. The tool will have to be very fast. The tool will have to be able to create an AI model in a few seconds. But we cannot create directly the model on the web site because we don't have enough computing power at the begining of the project. So we will create the script for the user and we will ask him to run it on a powerful computer.

### **2.6. Scalability**

The scalability of the tool will be very important. The tool will have to be able to create an AI model for a lot of users. The tool will have to be able to create an AI model for a lot of data. 

### **2.7. Reliability**

The reliability of the tool will be very important. The tool will have to be very reliable. The tool will have to be able to create an AI model for a lot of users. The tool will have to be able to create an AI model for a lot of data.

### **2.8. Maintainability**

The maintainability of the tool will be very important. The tool will have to be very easy to maintain. The tool will have to be very easy to update.

### **2.9. Conclusion**

The conclusion is that the architecture of the tool will be a web application. The user interface of the tool will be very clean and simple. With an UX/UI design that will be very intuitive and easy to use. The database of the tool will be a NoSQL database. The security of the tool will be very important. The performance of the tool will be very important. The scalability of the tool will be very important. The reliability of the tool will be very important. The maintainability of the tool will be very important.
