# Project Vision

My project aims to create a realistic virtual environment that simulates an electronic music festival. This environment will feature dynamic, AI-generated light shows that respond in real-time to music. The core innovation of my project lies in the AI's ability to analyze any given music track and choreograph a unique light show that complements the rhythm, mood, and intensity of the music.

# My vision of this innovative project

Imagine stepping into a virtual world where you are transported to the center stage of a massive electronic music festival. The crowd roars with excitement as the DJ drops the first beat, and the music pulses through the air. But what sets this experience apart is the dazzling light show that unfolds before your eyes.

As the music builds, the lights intensify, casting vibrant colors and patterns across the stage and the surrounding environment. Laser beams cut through the air, strobes flash in sync with the beat, and LED screens display mesmerizing visuals that dance to the music's rhythm. The entire spectacle is a symphony of light and sound, a dynamic and immersive experience that captivates your senses.

# Objectives

To ensure clarity and focus, I've divided my objectives into **Primary Objectives** and **Secondary Objectives**.

## Primary Objectives

These are must-have features that form the core of my project:

1. **AI Music Analysis**: Develop or integrate an AI system capable of analyzing music tracks in real-time or near-real-time, identifying key elements like beat, tempo, mood, and changes in musical sections.
2. **Dynamic Light Show Generation**: Based on the AI's music analysis, create algorithms that generate synchronized light effects. This includes varying colors, intensities, and movements that match the music's dynamics.
3. **Virtual Environment Creation**: Design and implement a 3D virtual space that simulates an electronic festival stage, complete with audience areas, a DJ booth, and speaker systems. This space should be visually appealing and optimized for performance.
4. **User Interaction**: Allow users to upload their music tracks and witness the AI-generated light show in the virtual environment. Provide basic controls for navigating the virtual space or adjusting the viewpoint.

## Secondary Objectives

These features enhance the project but are not critical for the basic functionality:

1. **Advanced Lighting Effects**: Develop advanced lighting effects such as lasers, strobes, and LED screen visuals to further enhance the light show.
2. **Interactive Elements**: Introduce interactive elements within the virtual environment, such as crowd reactions, or allow users to make real-time adjustments to the light show parameters.
3. **Environmental Variations**: Offer different festival environments (e.g., indoor club, outdoor festival stage) for the light shows, adding variety and broader applicability.
4. **Social Sharing**: Implement features for users to share their custom light shows or experiences on social media platforms, increasing the project's visibility and user engagement.

# Scope

My project's scope reflects what is realistically achievable within my timeframe and with the resources at my disposal. Considerations include:

- **Timeframe**: I will set milestones and deadlines based on how much time I have until my diploma project is due.
- **Skills**: I have assessed my current skills in AI, programming, and 3D modeling, identifying areas where I might need to learn or seek help.
- **Resources**: I have considered the software, hardware, and any potential costs (e.g., for assets or tools) that my project will require.

# Deliverables

My defined deliverables for this project include:

- A working prototype of the virtual festival environment.
- An AI module capable of analyzing music and generating a synchronized light show.
- Documentation covering my development process, AI model design, and user guide for interacting with the virtual environment.

Setting clear objectives and a defined scope will help guide my project, making it manageable and allowing for focused efforts on achieving my vision. I'm prepared to be flexible and willing to adjust my scope based on progress and feedback.

# Technology Stack

## AI and Music Analysis

- **AI Framework**: TensorFlow for developing and training machine learning models.
- **Music Analysis Libraries**: LibROSA for extracting audio features like tempo, beat, and spectral information.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Consider tools like TensorFlow Lite for on-device processing to enable real-time music analysis.

## Virtual Environment

- **Game Engine**: Unreal Engine for creating the 3D virtual environment.
- **3D Modeling**: Blender for creating custom 3D assets and optimizing them for real-time rendering.
- **Lighting Effects**: Unreal Engine's lighting and particle systems for dynamic light shows.
- **User Interaction**: Unreal Engine's Blueprint system for implementing user controls and interactions.
- **Optimization**: Techniques like level of detail (LOD) management and occlusion culling for performance optimization.

## API 

- **Custom API Development**: For handling user music uploads, communication between the AI module and the virtual environment, and managing user interactions.

## Deployment

- **Platform**: PC/Desktop deployment for the initial prototype.
- **Future Considerations**: Potential VR integration for immersive experiences.

--------------------

# Future Improvements

While my project's core focus is on creating a virtual music festival experience, there are several avenues for future improvements and expansions:

1. **AI Refinement**: Continuously improve the AI's music analysis capabilities to generate more nuanced and detailed light shows.
2. **Music Genre Adaptation**: Develop genre-specific light show algorithms to cater to different music styles.
3. **Collaborative Features**: Enable multiple users to experience the virtual festival together or collaborate on creating light shows.
4. **Live Event Integration**: Explore possibilities for live streaming real-world music events into the virtual environment.
5. **Create my own professional engine**(*the dream*): I would like to create my own engine to have more control over the project and to have a better understanding of the engine. And allow other developers to use it.
