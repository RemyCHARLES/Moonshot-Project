# The Vet App

App Name: [Undefined]
Business Plan: [Undefined]

## Purpose
The purpose of this application is to provide pet owners with a tool to calculate the appropriate amount of pet food to give to their puppies based on various factors such as breed, weight, and sterilization status. Additionally, the app will leverage artificial intelligence (AI) to provide personalized nutritional recommendations for each puppy. This application will be independent of the company "VetSaveur" and will initially focus on this functionality. Future plans may include a digital health book for animals, but details are still being defined.

## Use Cases
- **UC-1:** A Bernese Mountain Dog breeder who needs to track the nutritional needs of all their animals quickly.
- **UC-2:** A young family living in an apartment who wants to add a small sterilized Yorkie Terrier puppy to their family, but is unsure how much to feed the pet.
- **UC-3:** A veterinarian who wants an application to remotely monitor their clients' animals.

The app will use machine learning algorithms to analyze data on a puppy's breed, weight, activity level, and other factors to determine the ideal amount of food and nutrition required for good health. This personalized nutritional recommendation will help pet owners ensure that their puppies receive the appropriate nutrition they need to thrive.

With the addition of AI-powered features, this app will provide an innovative and efficient solution to the challenges of pet nutrition.

## More about the AI 

The AI component of the app will use machine learning algorithms to analyze data on a puppy's breed, weight, activity level, and other relevant factors to determine the ideal amount and type of food and nutrition required for optimal health.

The machine learning algorithms will be trained on a large dataset of pet nutrition information and will use this data to develop predictive models that can accurately predict a puppy's nutritional requirements based on its specific characteristics.

The app will also be designed to adapt and improve over time, as it receives more data and feedback from users. This will enable the AI to provide increasingly accurate and personalized nutritional recommendations, which will ultimately help pet owners ensure that their puppies receive the best possible care and nutrition.
