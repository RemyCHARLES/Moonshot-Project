# Decentralized Social Media Platform

## Introduction

This project is dedicated to building a decentralized social media platform leveraging blockchain technology to ensure user data privacy and security.

## Project Scope

This document outlines the project's vision, scope, technical stack, timeline, and roadmap.

## Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize the social media landscape by introducing a platform that prioritizes user data privacy and ownership through decentralization.

## Features

- **User Profiles**: Authentication and user profile management with decentralized identity solutions.
- **Content Sharing**: Ability for users to create, edit, and delete posts, leveraging IPFS for decentralized content storage.
- **Interactions**: Comment, like, share functionality using smart contracts to record interactions on the blockchain.
- **Decentralized Storage**: Utilize IPFS/Filecoin for decentralized user data storage.
- **Blockchain-Based Transactions**: Use Ethereum smart contracts for secure, trustless transactions like tipping creators.
- **Privacy and Security**: Strong encryption techniques for data privacy. Users have exclusive access to their data.

## Technology Stack

- **Blockchain**: Ethereum / Cardano / Polkadot (Choose based on requirement and resources)
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity for Ethereum or language suitable for chosen blockchain platform
- **Decentralized Storage**: IPFS / Filecoin
- **Front-End**: React.js with Redux for state management
- **Back-End**: Express.js with Node.js
- **Database**: MongoDB / PostgreSQL for off-chain data if needed

## Development Roadmap & Timeline

1. **Market and User Research** (Weeks 1-2): Understand user needs and market conditions. Identify competition and potential opportunities.

2. **Define Vision and Scope** (Weeks 3-4): Define problem statement, features, and scope. Prepare a detailed feature list.

3. **Prototype Design** (Weeks 5-7): Design initial UI/UX with Sketch/Figma/Adobe XD. Create wireframes and clickable prototypes.

4. **Choose Tech Stack** (Week 4): Decide technologies based on project needs and team skills.

5. **Develop MVP** (Weeks 8-20): Begin development with core features. Divide tasks among front-end, back-end, and blockchain developers.

6. **Testing** (Weeks 21-23): Perform comprehensive testing. Ensure contract security through rigorous testing and possibly third-party auditing.

7. **Launch and Iterate** (Week 24): Release MVP to select group of users. Gather feedback and make improvements.

8. **User Acquisition** (Weeks 25-32): Expand user base through marketing efforts, community building, partnerships, etc.

9.  **Monitor and Improve** (Week 33 and onwards): Continuously monitor user feedback and market trends to implement new features and improvements.

## Conclusion

Building a decentralized social media platform is a challenging yet rewarding endeavor. By focusing on user privacy, data ownership, and decentralization, we aim to redefine the concept of social media.
