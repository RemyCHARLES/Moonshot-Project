# Project Vision

My project aims to create a realistic virtual environment that simulates an electronic music festival. This environment will feature dynamic, AI-generated light shows that respond in real-time to music. The core innovation of my project lies in the AI's ability to analyze any given music track and choreograph a unique light show that complements the rhythm, mood, and intensity of the music.

# Objectives

To ensure clarity and focus, I've divided my objectives into **Primary Objectives** and **Secondary Objectives**.

## Primary Objectives

These are must-have features that form the core of my project:

1. **AI Music Analysis**: Develop or integrate an AI system capable of analyzing music tracks in real-time or near-real-time, identifying key elements like beat, tempo, mood, and changes in musical sections.
2. **Dynamic Light Show Generation**: Based on the AI's music analysis, create algorithms that generate synchronized light effects. This includes varying colors, intensities, and movements that match the music's dynamics.
3. **Virtual Environment Creation**: Design and implement a 3D virtual space that simulates an electronic festival stage, complete with audience areas, a DJ booth, and speaker systems. This space should be visually appealing and optimized for performance.
4. **User Interaction**: Allow users to upload their music tracks and witness the AI-generated light show in the virtual environment. Provide basic controls for navigating the virtual space or adjusting the viewpoint.

## Secondary Objectives

These features enhance the project but are not critical for the basic functionality:

1. **Advanced Lighting Effects**: Develop advanced lighting effects such as lasers, strobes, and LED screen visuals to further enhance the light show.
2. **Interactive Elements**: Introduce interactive elements within the virtual environment, such as crowd reactions, or allow users to make real-time adjustments to the light show parameters.
3. **Environmental Variations**: Offer different festival environments (e.g., indoor club, outdoor festival stage) for the light shows, adding variety and broader applicability.
4. **Social Sharing**: Implement features for users to share their custom light shows or experiences on social media platforms, increasing the project's visibility and user engagement.

# Scope

My project's scope reflects what is realistically achievable within my timeframe and with the resources at my disposal. Considerations include:

- **Timeframe**: I will set milestones and deadlines based on how much time I have until my diploma project is due.
- **Skills**: I have assessed my current skills in AI, programming, and 3D modeling, identifying areas where I might need to learn or seek help.
- **Resources**: I have considered the software, hardware, and any potential costs (e.g., for assets or tools) that my project will require.

# Deliverables

My defined deliverables for this project include:

- A working prototype of the virtual festival environment.
- An AI module capable of analyzing music and generating a synchronized light show.
- Documentation covering my development process, AI model design, and user guide for interacting with the virtual environment.

Setting clear objectives and a defined scope will help guide my project, making it manageable and allowing for focused efforts on achieving my vision. I'm prepared to be flexible and willing to adjust my scope based on progress and feedback.
