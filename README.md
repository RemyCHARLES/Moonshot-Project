## What is it ?

A Moonshot project is a visionary endeavor inspired by personal passion, aiming for groundbreaking technological advancements. Leveraging software and innovation, it pushes boundaries to create revolutionary products or services, showcasing one's expertise and ambition.

## Why ? 

The Moonshot project is a way to demonstrate my skills and knowledge in the field of software development. It is also one of the criteria I have to pass to get my diploma.

## What is my Moonshot ?

My Moonshot project is a decentralized social media platform. It is a project that I have been thinking about for a long time and that I would like to develop in the future. I am convinced that the future of social media lies in decentralization. I am also convinced that the blockchain is the technology that will allow us to achieve this.
