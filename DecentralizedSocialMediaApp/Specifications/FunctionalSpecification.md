## 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed functional specification for the development of a blockchain-based social media platform. This platform aims to leverage blockchain technology to offer enhanced privacy, user empowerment, and innovative engagement methods through the use of a proprietary cryptocurrency. The document outlines the system's overall functionality, specific requirements, and user interactions.

### 1.2 Scope
This specification covers the design and development aspects of the social media platform, including user account management, content posting and interaction, cryptocurrency integration, blockchain functionality, security, and performance requirements. It will serve as a guiding framework for developers, designers, and stakeholders involved in the project.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- Blockchain: A decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across multiple computers.
- Cryptocurrency: A digital or virtual currency secured by cryptography, operating independently of a central bank.
- Smart Contract: Self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code.
- MVP (Minimum Viable Product): The most basic version of a product that can be released.

### 1.4 References
- [Blockchain Technology Overview](https://www.blockchain.com/)
- [Introduction to Cryptocurrency](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-cryptocurrency)

### 1.5 Overview
The document is structured to first provide an overall description of the platform, followed by detailed specifications of system features and requirements. Subsequent sections cover blockchain and smart contract specifics, user interface design, security specifications, performance requirements, quality attributes, and compliance standards. The document concludes with appendices and an index for easy navigation.
