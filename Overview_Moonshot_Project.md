# Overview of the Moonshot Project

For the moment, I am still looking for my Moonshot Project. But even if I don't have a validated idea yet, I'm still thinking about it and looking for the ideal idea. Since the start of the year I have been search in the world around me and how to make it simpler or make it better.

## **1. The Vet App**

    My father is a veterinarian in the petfood industry and he has a lot of work. as a majority shareholder of his company and after a long conversation with him I realised that we could create a hundred tools that could help him and avoid a lot of parasitic work such as answering clients who ask him how much food they should give to their puppy because it is a very complex calculation that the customers cannot guess alone. So I thought about creating an app that would allow the customer to enter the weight of his puppy and the age of his puppy and the app would calculate the amount of food he should give to his puppy.

## **2. The AI Model Interface Creator**

    This idea is about creating a tool that will allow to create an AI model for each user who wants an Artificial Intelligence model for his project. This tool will be a web application that will allow the user to create his own AI model. The user will be able to choose the type of model he wants to create, the type of data he wants to use and the type of data they want to predic.

## **3. The NFI (Non-Fungible Item)**

    How to merge my two passion in one Idea? Create a video game who each item is written to the blockchain by a contract in the same way as the NFT. The player will be able to win, buy or sell item inside the game, this includes that there will be several rarity grades and it will be an open world game with a lot different game inside it, like an other world where the player can race cars, play golf or poker, for example.
